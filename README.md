# Neural Optimal Transport for 3D Mnist samples

The whole repo is based on beautiful [NOT paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=d8CBRlWNkqH) & corresponding [Repo](https://github.com/iamalexkorotin/NeuralOptimalTransport), with modification such that NOT finds weak optimal transport plan between [3D Mnist samples](https://openreview.net/forum?id=d8CBRlWNkqH).
