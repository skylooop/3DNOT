## Implementation of NOT for 3D MNIST image pairings
The Whole repo is based on beautiful [NOT paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=d8CBRlWNkqH) & [Repo](https://github.com/iamalexkorotin/NeuralOptimalTransport) with modification such that NOT finds Weak optimal transport plan between [3D Mnist dataset](https://openreview.net/forum?id=d8CBRlWNkqH).
